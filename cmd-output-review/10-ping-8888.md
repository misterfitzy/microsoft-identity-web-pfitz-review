## Summary
ICMP ping to Google's public DNS (8.8.8.8) failed with 100% packet loss. This indicates:
- ICMP traffic is blocked (firewall rules or network policy)
- The environment allows HTTP/HTTPS traffic (curl worked) but blocks ICMP
- Common in containerized/sandboxed environments for security reasons
